# Why?
The real reason this project was started because I wanted to learn Kotlin in a way that actually has useful output & values to some.

# Current features
* Instant KLSE stock price information by symbol name.
* Get current list of top gainers and top losers.

# Upcoming features
* Save favorite list. 
* Interval notification on user selected stock price change (of course real-time notification is resource intensive for now).
